# DarwinSimulation

Project for Object Oriented Programming course.

## The main goal

The task was to create a simulation of animals population and give a feedback by displaying 
a simple animation of the animals moving on a squared map.

A single animal was supposed to move along the map and encounter grass which he could eat or another animal with whom it could mate.
Population could die out if all of animals starved to death.

The most important part was to implement gene mutation system. If two animals had a baby, it had genes derived from its parents.
Additionaly some of the genes had to be mutated in order to introduce some diversity into the system.
